# c3bai Pricing Page: Implementation Guide
**For the Common Man + Live Projects + Fair Inquiry Pricing**

**Status**: Ready to Deploy (Feb 2026)  
**Target**: Make pricing crystal clear, show real work, collect structured inquiries, plan POC section

---

## Core Philosophy

Your pricing must answer three questions a prospect has:

1. **What are you actually selling?** "Engineering hours at a professional rate"
2. **How much will my project cost?** "Here's how we estimate based on your scope"
3. **Can I see proof you deliver?** "Yes, here are real projects we shipped"

---

## PART 1: Pricing Page Structure (The Common Man)

### Hero Section (30 seconds to understand)

```
HEADLINE:
"Real Engineering Hours. Real AI Systems. Real Results."

SUBHEADING:
"You're not buying API access. You're buying 20-160 hours of experienced engineering 
per month to build, optimize, and scale your AI system. At $125/hour."

VISUAL:
Three cards showing the math:
  [$2,500 = 20 hours]  [$7,500 = 60 hours]  [$20K+ = 160+ hours]
```

### Price Tiers (Transparent Breakdown)

Each tier should show:
1. **What you're getting** (hours, not features)
2. **What's included** (specific deliverables)
3. **Example projects** (real scope)
4. **Who it's for** (target customer)

## PART 3: FAQ (Answer Real Objections)

### "How much will my project cost?"

**Answer**: It depends on scope. We size projects based on:
- Token volume (how much inference?)
- Data processing (how many documents?)
- Customization (how much custom logic?)
- Timeline (fast sprint or long build?)

**Example**: "A booking system like Beltline Golf = 124 hours = fits Starter tier for 6 months"

Use the inquiry form to get specifics.

### "Why do you charge a setup fee?"

**Answer**: The setup fee covers real work:
- 20-40 hours of our time (consultation, integration, testing, docs)
- Infrastructure setup (dashboards, monitoring, APIs)
- Security audit (compliance, authentication, permissions)
- Onboarding training (your team learns the system)

Not "activating your account" (which takes 5 minutes). Real engineering.

### "What if I go over the included tokens?"

**Answer**: 
- **Transparent pricing**: You see overage costs before they happen
- **Annual cap**: Can't exceed cap without explicit approval
- **Optimization**: We proactively find ways to reduce usage (usually saves money)
- **Example**: Starter tier at 80% cap triggers cost optimization review

### "Can I get a discount?"

**Answer**:
- **Annual prepay**: 10-15% off if you pay upfront
- **Multi-seat**: Volume discounts at 3+ concurrent seats
- **Long-term**: 20-30% discounts for 3+ year commitments (Enterprise)
- **Not**: Never discount base rate. You're getting market-fair pricing already.

### "What if I only need help for a month or two?"

**Answer**: Two options:
1. **Pick a tier, commit 12 months** (with 25% early exit option if needed)
2. **Hourly consulting** ($125/hr) if under 20 hours/month

Most find the monthly retainer better (predictable, no surprises).

### "How do I know you'll actually deliver?"

**Answer**: 
- Look at our portfolio projects (below)
- All documented with real code, real results
- 100% success rate on 5+ completed projects
- First month is low-risk (25% exit fee is tiny if disappointed)

### "Do you work with [technology X]?"

**Answer**: Yes. We're technology-agnostic:
- Any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local models)
- Any stack (Next.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Any data source (databases, APIs, files, streams)

Tell us your tech stack in the inquiry form.

### "What's your SLA? What if you miss a deadline?"

**Answer**:
- **Starter/Professional**: Best-effort, no SLA
- **Enterprise**: Custom SLA negotiated (typically 99.9% uptime)
- **Communication**: We communicate delays immediately
- **Remediation**: If we miss deadlines, we credit hours back

## PART 6: Proof of Concept Section (Future Feature)

### Timeline: After core pricing is live (Phase 2, March 2026)

### Purpose: Show prospects exactly what "good" looks like before they buy

**Structure**:

```
PROOF OF CONCEPT GALLERY

"Real solutions to real problems. 
See the project, the approach, and the result."

Each POC shows:
1. The problem statement
2. Our approach (technical decision)
3. The code/solution (GitHub repo or demo)
4. Real metrics (performance, cost, uptime)
5. Lessons learned (what worked, what we'd change)
```

### POC Examples (What to post):

**POC #1: "Streaming Tokens to Cut Latency"**
- Problem: Long LLM responses feeling slow
- Solution: Implement token streaming (SSE)
- Result: 8.5s perceived latency → 1.5s (user sees text appearing)
- Code: GitHub repo link
- Metric: 60% faster perceived speed
- Cost: <$5 per 1M tokens with streaming

**POC #2: "Reducing Token Costs 40% with Smart Caching"**
- Problem: Same questions = repeated expensive LLM calls
- Solution: Semantic caching + Redis
- Result: 40% cost reduction on common queries
- Code: Reference implementation
- Metric: Saved customer $2K/month on tokens
- Trade-off: +50ms latency (acceptable)

**POC #3: "Building Reliable Webhooks (Retry Logic)"**
- Problem: Webhook delivery failures on network hiccups
- Solution: Exponential backoff + dead-letter queue
- Result: 99.95% delivery rate
- Code: Production pattern
- Metric: 1 failed webhook per 2,000 events
- Bonus: Dashboard to monitor failures

**POC #4: "Multimodal Input (Image + Text Prompts)"**
- Problem: Customers want to ask questions about images
- Solution: Vision API + structured outputs
- Result: GPT-4V integration (with token math)
- Code: Next.js + OpenAI example
- Metric: $0.03/image processing cost
- Real use: Beltline Golf competition photo analysis

**POC #5: "Handling Rate Limits (Provider Orchestration)"**
- Problem: Hit OpenAI rate limit, what now?
- Solution: Fallback to Anthropic, queue requests
- Result: Zero downtime despite rate limits
- Code: Router pattern
- Metric: 99.9% uptime during traffic spikes
- Real scenario: What happens during viral moment

### POC Implementation:

1. Each POC = 1 GitHub repo + 1 blog post
2. Every month: pick 1 completed project, extract POC
3. New POCs refresh monthly
4. Searchable: by problem type, by technology, by cost-saving potential

### Why This Works:

- **De-risks your decision**: "I can see how they solve problems"
- **Educational**: Customers learn about LLM best practices
- **Differentiator**: Consulting firms don't share code. You do.
- **Lead magnet**: POCs drive organic traffic (Google, HN, Reddit)
- **Recruiting**: Engineers see production code + see your standards

- [ ] Train sales process (yourself or team)
- [ ] Test full flow (submit → response → quote → sign)

**Deliverable**: End-to-end inquiry → quote → contract workflow

### PHASE 4: POC Gallery (March, after core is live)

- [ ] Plan 5 POC topics (from completed projects)
- [ ] Create GitHub repos (clean, documented code)
- [ ] Write blog posts explaining each (link from POC page)
- [ ] Add code samples to c3bai site
- [ ] Make searchable/filterable

**Deliverable**: Proof-of-concept gallery showing your approach

## Key Messaging (Repeating Throughout)

### When they see your pricing:
"You're not buying API access. You're buying experienced engineering hours at market rate. $125/hour, packaged as 20/60/160+ hour monthly commitments."

### When they see your projects:
"This is what $125/hour engineering delivers. Real problems. Real solutions. Real results."

### When they inquire:
"We'll estimate your project scope honestly. No surprise bills. No upsells. Just fair pricing based on what you actually need."

## Best Practices Applied

✅ **Transparency**: Show exactly what they're getting (hours, not magic)  
✅ **Proof**: 5 real projects, 100% success rate  
✅ **Education**: FAQ explains pricing, inquiry form teaches scope estimation  
✅ **Simplicity**: One page = pricing, one page = projects, one form = inquiry  
✅ **Fairness**: $125/hour consistent across all tiers (only commitment differs)  
✅ **Structure**: Inquiry form makes fair estimates possible
