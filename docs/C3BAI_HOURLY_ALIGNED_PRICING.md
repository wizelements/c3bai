# c3bai Pricing: Hourly Rate Alignment + Best Practices

**Hourly Rate**: $125/hour (from Beltline agreement post-warranty support rate)  
**Target**: Align monthly pricing with hourly rate + industry best practices  
**Date**: February 4, 2025

---

## Quick Alignment: $125/hour → Monthly Pricing

### Math
```
$125/hour × 40 hours/week = $5,000/week
$125/hour × 160 hours/month = $20,000/month
$125/hour × 1,920 hours/year = $240,000/year
```

### Industry Rule: 3-Tier by Delivery Hours

**Tier Structure Based on Monthly Hour Allocation**:

| Tier | Dedication | Monthly Rate | Hourly Equivalent | Best For |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 4-6 hrs/week | $2,500 | ~$13/hour* | MVPs, proof-of-concept |
| **Professional** | 12-16 hrs/week | $7,500 | ~$12/hour* | Production systems |
| **Enterprise** | 32+ hrs/week | $20,000+ | $13-16/hour* | Mission-critical |

*Lower effective hourly rate because of bulk commitment + efficiency gains

## Best Practices Applied

### ✅ 1. Cost-Plus Markup Model
```
Your Cost: $125/hour (fully loaded)
Markup: 1.5-3x depending on tier
├─ Starter: 1.5x = $187.50/hour effective (bulk discount)
├─ Professional: 1.75x = $219/hour effective
└─ Enterprise: 2x = $250/hour effective (dedicated resource)
```

**Rationale**: 
- Starter gets discount for predictable, lower-touch service
- Professional gets moderate markup for coordination overhead
- Enterprise gets premium for dedicated capacity

### ✅ 2. Value-Based Pricing Anchors
```
Comparison to alternatives:

OpenAI API Direct:
  $0.01-0.06 per 1K tokens (no management)
  Dev cost: $150K/year to manage in-house
  
Your Service:
  $2,500-7,500/month = managed, optimized, strategic
  Value: Saves $150K+ in engineering salary
  ROI: 2-5x for most customers
```

### ✅ 3. Upfront Fee Justification (Beltline Model)
```
Starter Setup: $2,500 = 20 hours implementation
├─ Consultation (2 hrs)
├─ API integration (8 hrs)
├─ Testing & validation (6 hrs)
├─ Documentation (4 hrs)

Professional Setup: $5,000 = 40 hours
├─ Consultation (4 hrs)
├─ Complex integration (16 hrs)
├─ Custom model setup (12 hrs)
├─ Training & documentation (8 hrs)

Enterprise Setup: 10% of annual
├─ Custom infrastructure design
├─ Multi-provider orchestration
├─ Compliance audit
├─ SLA negotiation
```

**Best Practice**: Upfront fees prevent low-quality leads and cover true implementation costs.

### ✅ 4. Consumption Model Alignment

```
Include realistic monthly capacity:

Starter (100K tokens = ~$6-15 value from OpenAI)
├─ Included to encourage usage
├─ Overage: $0.02/1K input, $0.06/1K output
├─ Cap: $50K/year overages (prevents runaway)

Professional (1M tokens = ~$60-150 value)
├─ Included with discount tier pricing
├─ Overage: $0.015/1K input, $0.045/1K output
├─ Cap: $150K/year overages (production scale)

Enterprise (Unlimited negotiated)
├─ Typically 80%+ customers don't hit overages
├─ Overages included or flat-rate add-ons
├─ Focus on utilization, not cap enforcement
```

### ✅ 5. Contract Terms (Proven from Beltline)

**12-Month Initial Term** (auto-renew)
```
Customer commitment = 12 × monthly fee
Developer commitment = dedicated capacity
Early exit = 25% of remaining balance
```

**Why 12 months**:
- Short enough for customer to commit
- Long enough to recoup onboarding cost
- Aligns with fiscal year budgeting
- Annual renewals create natural upsell moments

**Early Termination Math**:
```
Starter ($2,500/mo), exit after 4 months:
├─ Owed through month 4: Already paid
├─ Remaining: 8 months × $2,500 = $20,000
├─ Exit fee: 25% × $20,000 = $5,000
└─ Customer pays: $5,000 to exit

Professional ($7,500/mo), exit after 6 months:
├─ Owed through month 6: Already paid
├─ Remaining: 6 months × $7,500 = $45,000
├─ Exit fee: 25% × $45,000 = $11,250
└─ Customer pays: $11,250 to exit
```

**Effect**: Encourages long-term commitment without locking in customer permanently

### ✅ 6. Payment Terms Best Practice

```
Industry Standard:
├─ Invoice date: 1st of month
├─ Due date: 15th of month (Net 15)
├─ Late fee: 1.5% per month if >15 days late
├─ Suspension: Auto-stop service after 30 days non-payment
├─ Reinstatement: Full payment + $500 recovery fee

Why this works:
• Clear 15-day expectation (not fuzzy)
• Monthly cycle matches subscription model
• 1.5% late fee (18%/year) matches credit card rates
• 30-day grace period before suspension (fair)
• $500 recovery fee covers costs of restart
```

### ✅ 7. Annual Discount Strategy

```
Offer 10-15% discount for annual prepayment

Starter:
  Monthly: $2,500 × 12 = $30,000
  Annual: $27,000 (10% discount)
  Savings: $3,000

Professional:
  Monthly: $7,500 × 12 = $90,000
  Annual: $76,500 (15% discount)
  Savings: $13,500

Enterprise:
  Negotiated 20-30% discount based on commitment
```

**Financial Impact**:
- Improves cash flow (prepayment)
- Reduces payment processing costs
- Incentivizes longer commitment
- Typical SaaS annual discount: 10-20% ✓

### ✅ 8. Support SLA by Tier (Industry Standard)

```
Starter Tier:
├─ Response time: 24-48 hours
├─ Availability: Business hours only
├─ Channels: Email only
└─ Resolution goal: 5 business days

Professional Tier:
├─ Response time: 4-8 hours
├─ Availability: Business hours + emergency
├─ Channels: Slack + email + phone
└─ Resolution goal: 24-48 hours

Enterprise Tier:
├─ Response time: 1 hour (any issue), 15 min (outage)
├─ Availability: 24/7/365
├─ Channels: Dedicated Slack channel + phone + email
└─ Resolution goal: 4 hours (SLA-backed)
```
