## What You Have Now

### 1. General SaaS Platform (Not AI-Focused)
✅ Works for web design, apps, software, integrations, MVPs, redesigns  
✅ Inquiry form asks about design scope, databases, integrations, platforms  
✅ Scope estimation works for ANY software project  
✅ Clear messaging: $125/hour or $65/hour partner rate

### 2. Progressive Web App (PWA)
✅ Installable on home screen (iOS, Android, Windows)  
✅ Works offline (Service worker caches pages)  
✅ Fast loading (cached assets load instantly)  
✅ Native app feel (no browser chrome)  
✅ Responsive design (mobile-first)

- **Timeline:** 8 weeks
- **Tech:** React, Node.js, Stripe API, Firebase

**2. TradeAlerts** - React Native app fixes (rapid sprint)

- **Investment:** $5K (40 hours)
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks

**Patterns we follow:**
- Clear problem (not "nice to have" features)
- Simple MVP (not feature-bloated)
- Focus on UX (users matter more than code)
