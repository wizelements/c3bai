# Best Practices: Web Design for Non-Technical Founders

A guide to building effective websites that convert visitors into customers.

## 1. Design Principles

### Clear Value Proposition
Your homepage should answer in 5 seconds: "What do you do and why should I care?"

**Don't:**
- Use vague taglines ("Leading innovators in cloud solutions")
- Bury your offer below the fold
- Assume visitors know what your company does

**Do:**
- Lead with a clear problem you solve
- Show the benefit, not the feature
- Use human language (avoid buzzwords)

**Example:**
```
❌ "Leveraging cutting-edge AI to optimize enterprise workflows"
✅ "Save 5 hours/week on invoicing. Get paid faster."
```

### Visual Hierarchy
Guide visitors' eyes to what matters most.

- **Heading**: Largest, most important message
- **Subheading**: Supporting context (1-2 sentences)
- **Body copy**: Details and benefits
- **CTA button**: "Get Started", "Schedule Demo", "See Pricing"

### Mobile First
60%+ of visitors arrive on mobile. Design for small screens first, then scale up.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Readable text without zooming
- [ ] Buttons are thumb-friendly (44px+ tall)
- [ ] Forms have one column on mobile
- [ ] Images scale properly
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

## 2. Homepage Structure

```
1. Hero Section
   - Headline (what you do)
   - Subheading (why it matters)
   - CTA button (primary action)
   - Background image or video

2. Problem Statement
   - "Here's what's broken"
   - Relate to visitor's pain
   - Build trust that you understand

3. Solution
   - "Here's how we fix it"
   - Show benefits, not features
   - Use examples or screenshots

4. How It Works
   - 3-5 steps to success
   - Simple, visual
   - Reduces friction/confusion

5. Results/Social Proof
   - Case study (if you have one)
   - Testimonials
   - Metrics (users, revenue, uptime)
   - Logos of companies using you

6. FAQ
   - Answer objections
   - Address pricing confusion
   - Clear navigation paths

7. Final CTA
   - "Ready to get started?"
   - Primary call-to-action
   - Trust signals (guarantees, fast setup)

8. Footer
   - Links (privacy, terms, contact)
   - Contact info
   - Newsletter signup (optional)
```

## 3. Copy (What to Write)

### Headline Formula
"[Service] that [specific outcome] so you can [bigger benefit]"

**Examples:**
- "Invoice software that gets you paid 5x faster"
- "Booking system for service businesses (no credit card required)"
- "Email templates that 3x your response rate"

### Subheading Formula
"For [target] who [specific pain], [how you solve it]"

**Examples:**
- "For freelancers who hate tracking time manually, we automate it"
- "For e-commerce founders who lose $10K/month to abandoned carts, we recover it"

### CTA Button Copy
- ❌ "Submit" (vague)
- ✅ "Get Free Estimate" (specific, benefit)
- ✅ "See Pricing" (clear action)
- ✅ "Try Free for 14 Days" (no risk)

### Section Copy Rules
- **Short paragraphs** (3 sentences max)
- **Active voice** ("We ship fast" not "Fast shipping is provided")
- **Specific benefits** ("Save 5 hours" not "Save time")
- **Address objections** ("No credit card required" "30-day money back guarantee")

## 4. User Experience (UX)

### Navigation
- **Simple** - 5-7 main items max
- **Clear labels** - "Services", "Pricing", "About", "Contact"
- **Mobile menu** - Hamburger menu for small screens
- **Sticky header** - Easy access while scrolling

### Forms
- **Minimal fields** - Ask only what you need
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show more fields only when needed
- **Clear labels** - "Your email" not "Email address"
- **Error messages** - Help users fix mistakes
- **Mobile-friendly** - Large inputs, no required keyboard symbols

**Good form:**
```
Name: [___________]
Email: [___________]
Company: [___________]
[✓] Subscribe to updates
[Send →]
```

**Bad form:**
```
First Name: [___]
Last Name: [___]
Email Address: [___________]
Phone Number: [___________]
Company Name: [___________]
Industry: [Select dropdown]
Number of Employees: [Select dropdown]
What's your budget?: [___________]
How did you hear about us?: [Select dropdown]
[Submit]
```

### Speed
- **Page load**: Under 3 seconds (ideally <2)
- **Time to interactive**: Users can click within 1 second
- **Lazy load images**: Only load images when visible
- **Compress assets**: Images, CSS, JavaScript

**Test tools:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)

## 5. Conversion Optimization

### Above the Fold
The first 600px users see without scrolling.

**Include:**
- Logo (or company name)
- Navigation
- Main headline
- Subheading
- Hero image/video
- Primary CTA button

**Exclude:**
- Secondary navigation
- Long explanations
- Secondary offers

### Trust Signals
What convinces visitors you're legitimate?

- **Social proof** - "1,000+ customers trust us"
- **Testimonials** - Real quotes from real customers
- **Company logos** - "Used by Acme Corp, TechCo, Startup Inc"
- **Credentials** - Certifications, awards, media mentions
- **Guarantees** - "30-day money-back guarantee" "If you don't save time, it's free"
- **Contact info** - Real phone number, email, address

### Call-to-Action (CTA)
Make it impossible to miss.

- **Color**: Contrasts with background (usually blue or green)
- **Size**: Larger than other buttons
- **Placement**: Multiple times on page (not just bottom)
- **Clear copy**: "Get Started" not "Click Here"
- **No form walls**: First CTA = free/no friction

**CTA placement:**
1. Hero section (top)
2. After problem/solution
3. Before objections (FAQ)
4. After results/proof
5. Footer (final chance)

### A/B Testing
Test variations to improve conversion.

**Good tests:**
- Headline variants ("Save time" vs "Get free time")
- CTA button color (blue vs green vs orange)
- Form fields (3 vs 5 fields)
- Hero image (photo vs illustration)

**Don't test:**
- Everything at once
- Small changes (grammar)
- Insignificant elements

**Measurement:**
- Track conversions (form submissions, signups)
- Calculate conversion rate (conversions ÷ visitors)
- Need 100+ conversions to be statistically significant

**Tools:**
