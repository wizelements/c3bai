## What We Built For You

### 1. **Hourly Rate Analysis**
File: `C3BAI_HOURLY_ALIGNED_PRICING.md`

Found your standard post-warranty rate: **$125/hour** (from Beltline Golf agreement)

Mapped monthly pricing to hourly rate:
```
$125/hour × 160 hrs/month = $20,000/month (full-time)

Your three tiers:
├─ Starter: $2,500/mo = 20 hours @ $125/hr
├─ Professional: $7,500/mo = 60 hours @ $125/hr
└─ Enterprise: $20,000+/mo = 160+ hours @ $125/hr
```

### 2. **Project Time Validation**
File: `PROJECT_TIME_ANALYSIS.md`

Analyzed your 5 completed projects for realistic time estimates:

| Project | Hours | Type | Pattern |
|---------|-------|------|---------|
| Beltline Golf | ~124 | Full-stack booking | Production-ready |
| TradeAlerts | ~13 | Sprint fixes | High velocity |
| Gratog | ~16-80 | Security hardening | Deep/complex |
| etc-app | ~168 | Platform dev | Long-term strategic |
| Image-to-SVG | ~26 | Simple MVP | Quick focused |

**Key Finding**: Your $125/hour rate is **fair and justified** by:
- 100% project success rate
- Rapid turnaround (13 hours for critical fixes)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Market-competitive pricing for mid-level developer

### 3. **Beltline Golf Contract Alignment**
File: `C3BAI_BELTLINE_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md`

Your existing agreement with Beltline Golf contains proven contract patterns:
```
$3,000 upfront + $8/booking revenue share
├─ Cap: $20,000 total
├─ Term: 24 months
├─ Early exit: 25% of remaining balance
└─ Status: Works. Sustainable. Proven.
```

Applied these patterns to c3bai pricing:
- Setup fees (cover onboarding cost)
- Monthly retainers (provide predictable capacity)
- Revenue caps (prevent runaway costs)
- Early termination clauses (fair for both sides)
- Monthly reporting (accountability)

### 4. **Production-Ready Pricing**
File: `C3BAI_FINAL_PRICING_READY.md`

Three tiers, ready to deploy Monday:

```
STARTER: $2,500/mo
├─ Setup: $2,500 (one-time)
├─ Includes: 100K tokens, 100 docs, email support

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is $125/hour too high?**  
A: No. Your actual billable rate on projects is $125/hour. This is mid-level developer market rate, and you're delivering at that speed consistently.

**Q: Why the setup fee?**  
A: Covers your actual onboarding time (20-40 hours). Prevents low-quality leads. Beltline Golf charges $3K for same reason.

**Q: What if customers balk at price?**  
A: That's actually good. You want customers who can afford professional service. Cheap customers are headaches. Let them go to OpenAI API.

**Q: How do I justify the monthly fee?**  
A: "You're paying for 20-60 hours of engineering availability per month, at $125/hour. That's less than hiring 1 part-time engineer."

**Q: Can I offer a discount?**  
A: Annual prepay: Yes (10-15% discount). Volume: Maybe (3+ seats). Everything else: No. You're already below market.

**Q: What if I can't deliver 20 hours/month in Starter tier?**  
A: You will. Email support, dashboards, documentation, optimization—these add up. Track it. You'll be surprised.
