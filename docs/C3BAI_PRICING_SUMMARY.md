## Why This Pricing Strategy Works

### ✅ Value-Based (Not Cost-Based)
- Pricing reflects customer value, not your infrastructure costs
- $2,500 Starter serves customers saving $30K+/year in alternative solutions

### ✅ Freemium to Paid Funnel
- Free consultation generates qualified leads
- 10-15% conversion to paid ($2,500+ ACV)
- Low CAC ($100-200 per consultation)

### ✅ Consumption + Fixed Hybrid
- Fixed monthly base = predictable revenue
- Overage model = captures usage growth (20-30% of base)
- Aligns pricing with customer success

### ✅ Clear Differentiation
- Starter = MVP validation (small projects, email support)
- Professional = Production systems (unlimited, priority support)
- Enterprise = Mission-critical (SLA, dedicated team)

### ✅ Defensible Margins
- 10x token markup (vs. OpenAI) = justified by managed service
- 50-100% margin on document processing
- Gross margin likely 80%+

## Competitive Advantage

You're positioned **between APIs and consulting**:

```
OpenAI API            ← Low cost, no support, DIY
├─ Pure consumption pricing
├─ No managed service
└─ High operational burden

YOUR SOLUTION  ← Sweet spot
├─ Managed service (reduces burden 90%)
├─ Multi-provider (not locked to OpenAI)
├─ Transparent pricing & cost tracking
└─ 24/7 support + optimization

Consulting Firms      ← High cost, high touch
├─ $5-15K engagement minimums
├─ 3-6 month implementations
└─ Fixed scope
```

**Unique Value Props**:
1. Transparency (show real latency, costs, token usage)
2. Managed (no hiring required)
3. Fast (days to deploy, not months)
4. Cost-effective (10x cheaper than hiring engineer)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Pricing too high | Medium | A/B test lower tier ($1,500) with 20% of leads |
| Pricing too low | Low | Monthly commitment minimum, quality gating |
| Support overhead | Medium | Tiered SLAs, automated monitoring, clear scope |
| Stripe integration issues | Low | Extensive testing Week 1, Stripe support standby |
| Low conversion rate | Medium | Improve consultation process, better positioning |
| Churn from Starter tier | Low | Automatic upsell triggers at 80% usage |
